# A list is a sequence type in python that is most similar to an array in javascript.  To create a new list in python, 
# use square brackets to surround the contents of the initial list.  A list type is denoted as "List".  Unlike Tuples,
# Lists are mutable data types and ususally contain a list of homogeniously typed items.

#Creating a new list
newList = [1,2,3]

#Adding to a list
newList.append(4)
