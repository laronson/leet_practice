#Everything in python is bascially an object.  Strings integers and even booleans are strings.  All of those classes
# have methods that you can call on those objects

#functions
# This is a function that we define on a file
def func(x):
    return x+5

#methods are functions that are called on objects (aka instance methods)
x = 'tim'
x.strip() #.strip() is a method
