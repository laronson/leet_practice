print("hello World")

print(4.5)

print(4.5,"hello") #The comma automatically adds a space between things that it will print

#By default, the end value of a print statement is a new line, however we can change the end
#character to be whatever we want by using end= in our print statement
print("hello", end='|') #Adds a pipe between print statements instead of a new line
print("world")
